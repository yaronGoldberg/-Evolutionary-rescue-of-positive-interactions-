The data accompanying the paper:
"Positive interactions within and between populations decrease the likelihood of evolutionary rescue".
Yaron Goldberg and Jonathan Friedman, Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel.

Data formats:

- Raw data is in the form of binary sequence where 0 is extinction and 1 is rescue. 
  Data stemmed for multiple parameter simulations (run with nested loops) is in the form of 1d sequence with linear indexing (param1,param2,rounds).
  
- Parsed data is in the form of a table with the parameters and the corresponding evolutionary rescue probability
